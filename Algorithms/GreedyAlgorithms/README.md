# Greedy Algorithms

## What is a greedy algorithm?

A greedy algorithm is an algorithm that follows the problem solving heuristic of making the locally optimal choice at each stage with the hope of finding a global optimum. In many problems, a greedy strategy does not in general produce an optimal solution, but nonetheless a greedy heuristic may yield locally optimal solutions that approximate a global optimal solution in a reasonable time.

## Greedy Algorithms

There are many greedy algorithms. The most common greedy algorithms are:

- [**Prim Algorithm**](PrimAlgorithm.md)
- [**Dijkstra's Algorithm**](DijkstrasAlgorithm.md)
