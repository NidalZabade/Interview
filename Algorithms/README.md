# Algorithms

## What is an algorithm?

An algorithm is a set of instructions that are executed in a specific order to solve a problem. It is a step-by-step procedure, which defines a set of instructions to be executed in a certain order to get the desired output.

## Why do we need algorithms?

Algorithms are used to make our lives easier. They are used in every aspect of our lives. For example, when you are cooking, you follow a recipe to make a dish. The recipe is an algorithm that tells you what to do and in what order to do it. Similarly, when you are driving, you follow the traffic rules to reach your destination. The traffic rules are an algorithm that tells you what to do and in what order to do it.
